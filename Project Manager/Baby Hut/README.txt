This folder includes details of an on-school project that aims to build a business information system using Wordpress. Our team consisted of 4 people with me as the leader.
This project won the first prize of a web-building contest and scored 91/100 by Swinburne University standard. 
In this project, I had:
- Addressed the business problem of communication and monitoring methods to develop a comprehensive solution proposal for the stakeholders.
- Led the development team to ensure quality and progress of development.
- Built a fully functional virtual store that enables the store chain system to perform data analysis on sales and website traffics. 
- Conducted a survey of 30 people on user-experiences to make improvements for the vitural store based on those insights.
